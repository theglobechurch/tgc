      <p>We are seriously excited about Jesus. His extraordinary life has changed the course of human history.</p>
      <p>In the Bible we find that in the beginning, we were created by God to enjoy life forever with him. But we chose to go it alone. We turned our backs and acted as if we were king.</p>
      <p>That rebellion set us on a terrible road. No longer do we enjoy the life we were created for. Instead, we now walk a road of suffering. Our steps are hard, and although we experience happiness, we also shed many tears. We walk a road that leads unavoidably to death – and beyond the grave, to God’s right but dreadful punishment.</p>
      <p>So far, so bad.</p>
      <p>But God has done the most extraordinary thing. He sent Jesus, his only Son, to live on Earth. Jesus lived the perfect life even while he walked our road of pain and suffering. He walked the road that led him ultimately to a cross where he died under God’s punishment. He did not deserve God’s punishment, but he took it in our place. He walked that road to the cross to save us. And then, after Jesus conquered death, God gave him life again. By his death and resurrection, Jesus has opened a new road for us to walk.</p>
      <p>As we follow Jesus, we walk a road of freedom. It is still hard. We still shed tears, but our ultimate destination is no longer death, but life. No longer punishment, but life forever with God. And as we walk this road, Jesus has given us his precious Holy Spirit to be our helper and comforter.</p>
      <p>Jesus is our champion. We want to know him better, so we read his Word, the Bible. We want to follow him.</p>
      <p>Jesus changes our story. If you have ever wondered about life and what it all means, then come and hear how Jesus makes sense of your story.</p>

      <p>Following Jesus is not an individual thing. Part of the genius of God’s plan is that he is creating a new humanity. He is saving a community of people.</p>
      <p>The scope of God’s plan is seen in this vision of the future:</p>
      <p><em>After this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb.</em> (Revelation 7:9, NIVUK).</p>
      <p>God’s plan is to save a great diversity of people.</p>
      <p>Human history is littered with examples of racism and exclusion. But the church is to be different. Here is a radical, diverse, and yet united body of people displaying God’s power to the world.</p>
      <p>It does not matter our social or ethnic or economic or educational backgrounds. We want The Globe Church to be a place where anyone can find a home. </p>

      <p>Have you ever wondered what the church is for? What is the point? What are we supposed to be doing? Jesus has made it very clear. In his final command to his people, he spells out our mission, <em>‘Go and make disciples of all nations’</em> (Matthew 28:19).</p>
      <p>That means going. Not sitting around and waiting for people to come to us, but going into our community. Into our workplaces. Into the hard places. Into our world.</p>
      <p>And we go with the clear aim of making disciples. We are unashamed of the fact that Jesus is a great king. We are convinced that God’s kingdom is glorious. So we want to call people to follow this king. Come and learn from him. Come and find forgiveness in him. Come and find rest and purpose and freedom in him. Come and be a disciple.</p>
      <p>There are lots of other good things we can be involved in, but making disciples is the reason The Globe Church exists.</p>
